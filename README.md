### Demo Part 5: Registration  
  
Since this user is new, they must fill in the registration page. However, they forgot to fill in the "Last name" textbox, which is mandatory. Validation is unsuccessful.  
![Registration Empty Textbox Warning](images/RegistrationEmptyTBWarning.gif)  
  
The user enters a last name, but their password is too short. Upon entering a longer password, the form is validated and an account is created for the user.  
![Registration Password Warning](images/RegistrationPwdWarning.gif)  
  
The user's information is stored in a CSV file called "accounts.csv", where a salt is added to the password and the result is hashed.
