Demo Part 5: Registration  
  
Since this user is new, they must fill in the registration page. However, they forgot to fill in the "Last name" textbox, which is mandatory. Validation is unsuccessful.

The user enters a last name, but their password is too short. Upon entering a longer password, the form is validated and an account is created for the user.

The user's information is stored in a CSV file called "accounts.csv", where a salt is added to the password and the result is hashed.
